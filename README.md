Epic Cape
=========

Initial submission for BeagleBone Cape Plug-in Board Design Contest.

The Epic Cape is a cape for the BeagleBone that adds a 802.15.4 wireless mesh networking interface.  The Epic Cape uses the Open Source Epic Core module (http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~prabal/projects/epic/) which allows the cape to act as a compact egress router for sensor network applications.  The Epic Core module is fully supported by the TinyOS sensor network operating system and runs an implementation of IPv6 for TinyOS (http://smote.cs.berkeley.edu:8000/tracenv/wiki/blip) that allows transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  The Epic Cape will allow you to develop an 802.15.4 wireless sensor network with IPv6 connectivity to each mesh endpoint.
